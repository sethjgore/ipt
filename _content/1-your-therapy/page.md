###Why integrated physical therapy?
Traditional physical therapy tends to be quantitative in nature, it looks at the amount in objective measurements (e.g. range of motion and strength) of single joints in the body rather than how two joints may work together or the body as a whole. Pilates based physical therapy (PT) on the other hand has allowed me to have a more qualitative take on PT. The body is complex and it is not efficient to look solely at one joint or injury when rehabilitating a person towards their goal.

###How will you address my injuries and issues?
When addressing an injury or problem, after healing has taken place it is not sufficient to solely stretch or strengthen muscles in isolation. It is essential to train the neuromuscular and musculoskeletal systems in coordination to allow the body to move well. When efficient movement patterns are achieved there is less “wear and tear” on the body and a longer “shelf life” in addition to a decrease in pain.
